## Using the SEN-21207 with the IN100

The SEN-21207 is a atmospheric sensor breakout board utilizing the IN100 to report sensor data from the BMA 400 chip. The BMA 400 is an ultra-low power, 3 axes accelerometer. To learn how to setup this sensor to use with the IN100, see the directory in this GitHub called "Bosch - BMA400 Accelerometer." In that directory, two configurations are covered, one with the BMA400 as a motion detector, and one with the BMA400 set to periodically report its axis data.

### Results

The config files needed to get this example are found in the aforementioned directory "Bosch - BMA400 Accelerometer" under this same GitHub account page.
